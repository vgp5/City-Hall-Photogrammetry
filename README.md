**Description:** The purpose of the project was to capture a virtual 3D model of the City Hall located in Newark, NJ and build a space that can be accessed in a VR device. This was done using drone photogrammetry, with combination of skills in Unity and Blender to refine the model and world.
The world is hosted in Spatial. For more details, please refer to the pdf.
